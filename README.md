## What is this?

FlipOff is a free, open-source web app that emulates a classic mechanical split-flap (flip-board) airport terminal display — the kind you'd see at train stations and airports. It runs full-screen in any browser, turning a TV or large monitor into a beautiful retro display.

No accounts. No subscriptions. No $199 fee. Just open `index.html` and go.

## Features

- Realistic split-flap animation with colorful scramble transitions
- Authentic mechanical clacking sound (recorded from a real split-flap display)
- Auto-rotating inspirational quotes
- Fullscreen TV mode (press `F`)
- Keyboard controls for manual navigation
- Works offline — zero external dependencies
- Responsive from mobile to 4K displays
- Pure vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — no frameworks, no build tools, no npm

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (or serve with any static file server)
3. Click anywhere to enable audio
4. Press `F` for fullscreen TV mode

```bash
# Or serve locally:
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Then open http://localhost:8080
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` / `Space` | Next message |
| `Arrow Left` | Previous message |
| `Arrow Right` | Next message |
| `F` | Toggle fullscreen |
| `M` | Toggle mute |
| `Escape` | Exit fullscreen |

## How It Works

Each tile on the board is an independent element that can animate through a scramble sequence (rapid random characters with colored backgrounds) before settling on the final character. Only tiles whose content changes between messages animate — just like a real mechanical board.

The sound is a single recorded audio clip of a real split-flap transition, played once per message change to perfectly sync with the visual animation.
